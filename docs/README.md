# Documentation Website

## Overview

This directory contains a static documentation website for the main repository. It is designed to provide an overview of the project, showcase the programming languages used, and list recent changes. The site is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is compatible with GitHub Pages.

## How it Works

The website dynamically displays:
- A list of programming languages found in the root of the repository.
- A list of the 10 most recent commit messages.

This information is sourced from the `docs/site_data.json` file.

The `docs/site_data.json` file is, in turn, generated by the Python script located at `docs/scripts/generate_site_data.py`. This script scans the repository for language directories and fetches commit history using Git commands.

## Updating the Website Content

To refresh the list of languages and recent commits displayed on the website, you need to regenerate the `docs/site_data.json` file. Follow these steps:

1.  **Navigate to the script directory:**
    Open your terminal and change your current directory to `docs/scripts/` relative to the repository root:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/repository/docs/scripts/
    ```

2.  **Run the generation script:**
    Execute the Python script:
    ```bash
    python generate_site_data.py
    ```
    *(You might need to use `python3 generate_site_data.py` depending on your system's Python installation and PATH configuration.)*

    This command will update the `docs/site_data.json` file with the latest information.

3.  **Commit and push the changes:**
    After running the script, you should commit the updated `docs/site_data.json` file (and any other files you may have modified, such as this README if you're improving documentation) to your Git repository:
    ```bash
    git add ../site_data.json
    git commit -m "docs: Update site_data.json with latest languages and commits"
    git push
    ```

**Requirements for the script:**
- Python 3 is required to run `generate_site_data.py`.
- The script uses standard Python libraries (`os`, `json`, `subprocess`) and requires `git` to be installed and accessible in your system's PATH for fetching commit history.

## Viewing Locally

To view the documentation website locally:

1.  Ensure that `docs/site_data.json` has been generated (run the script if not).
2.  Navigate to the `docs/` directory in your file explorer.
3.  Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## Automatic Updates (GitHub Pages)

A GitHub Actions workflow is planned to automate the execution of the `generate_site_data.py` script. This workflow will trigger on every push to the `main` branch, automatically update `docs/site_data.json`, and commit the changes. This ensures that the live documentation site hosted on GitHub Pages remains consistently up-to-date with the repository's latest state. (Note: This workflow needs to be implemented for automatic updates to function).
